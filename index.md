## Research & Engagement Program Vision
Consistent with the Mission, Vision, and Values of the Rockefeller Archive Center, the Research & Engagement Program envisions a broad and diverse community engaged in archival practice, primary source research, and historical understanding.

## Values of R&E
- Center equity, diversity, and accessibility
- Communicate with transparency and foster trust
- Build from user needs
- Empower each other and collaborate across programs
- Create from a foundation of research

## R&E Program Goals
- Invite global engagement with RAC collections and the body of research using them
- Empower educators to help learners of all levels to develop their media literacy, research, and critical thinking skills
- Engage in conversations with communities represented in and impacted by our work

## Guiding Principles of R&E's Work
* Public and Accessible
  * We build, use, and share open-source tools, records, systems, and content wherever possible.
  * We ensure our products are compatible with common software applications and digital tools.
  * We adhere to accessibility practices for typefaces, icons, images, and other design elements.
  * In our education work, we partner primarily with public institutions.
 
* Digital First
  * Our work is conceived, managed, designed, edited, discussed, and delivered in a digital environment. 
  * We aim to do more with less. A digital-first approach means that we have the potential to reach more user communities than we could using our physical space or traditional forms of research, communication, and dissemination.
  * Working digitally allows our team to be productive, inclusive, and respectful of social-emotional well-being.
  * In our projects and programs, we don’t assume physical access to our spaces, records, people, or products.

* Always Evolving
  * Our team fosters learner curiosity, encourages experimentation, and provides a safe space to try new tools and approaches.
  * Our work is never “finished.” We iterate, adjust, rework, and reinvent. 
 
* RAC Goals, not External Goals
  * We publish and promote research conducted through or related to our programs and goals. 
  * We do not partner with individuals or institutions whose primary goals are commercial.
  * We do not promote the strategies or missions of our donor/depositing organizations.

## Communities We Serve
* Educators and the learners they serve 
* Not-for-Profit Practitioners 
* Professionals in Archives, Archives-Adjacent, and Historical Fields
* Researchers

## Tone
Our content should be:
* Helpful
* Informative
* Approachable
* Inviting
* Friendly
* Research-Based
* Humble


## Editorial Process
We are a small team of individuals who wear many hats. There are key roles we play to carry out RAC and R&E goals through our content creation – most of us hold more than one role and some of these roles extend beyond the R&E team. This makes cross-programmatic teamwork and clear documentation essential to the success of our program.

Our aim is to insitute an editoral process that applies to all content produced across all platforms, regardless of publication venue, audience, or production tools.

## Editorial Calendar

The editorial calendar is developed with SMARTIE goals in mind. (Strategic Measurable Appropriate Realistic Time-bound Inclusive Equitable.) The team will draft a quarterly content plan for approval by the Director of R&E. Individual pieces of content are developed and managed through Asana. 

The quarterly content plans will include:
* The content R&E will produce, and plans for distribution
* Micro and macro goals for each piece of content
* Which staff members will handle each project and task
* Deadlines for each project and task


## Tools
Content production will be managed in Asana but as a general rule, will be produced and published in-platform. This practice may need to be revised and platforms and tools change.

## Measurement
We are a learning team; we strive to be responsive to meet the needs of our communities through our content. Measurement plays a crucial role in our editorial planning and annual strategy discussions. We draw on the following metrics:
* Web analytics
* Social media engagement metrics
* Persona development
* User testing
* User feedback

## Commenting Policy
* Comments that include hate speech will be removed and the offending accounts blocked.
* We comment to answer questions or express support for ideas that align with our values and goals.
* We “like” posts that relate to our work or the subjects of our holdings. Likes do not mean endorsement.
* We align our content practices with the [RAC Privacy Policy](https://rockarch.org/about-us/privacy-policy/) and with [RAC Mission, Vision, and Values](https://rockarch.org/about-us/mission-vision-values/).
